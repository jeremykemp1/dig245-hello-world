<p style="color:rgb(106, 106, 106);">Computer Science Major, Class of 2025</p>

<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Why DIG 245?</h1>
<p style="color:rgb(106, 106, 106);">I've decided to take DIG 245 because although I enjoy coding and creating things through computer science, 
    I am also really interested in designing things and being creative. I feel like this class really merges those two things
    together. </p>

<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Experiences</h1>
<p style="color:rgb(106, 106, 106);">I actually don't really have any expereinces specifically related to HTML and building websites. However, I do have experience 
    in both computer sceince courses as well as digital art and design courses. So hopefully I be able to pull things from both of them to help me in this class!
</p>

<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Goals</h1>
<p style="color:rgb(106, 106, 106);">I'd like to become relatively competant in coding. I would like to be competant enough to the point where my own creativity is my only limit, 
    however, I know that may be tricky to acheieve in one semester. Instead I'm happy to blend both simple creativity with a relativly basic level of coding to create some pretty cool things! 
</p>

<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Command Line Summary</h1>
<p style="color:rgb(106, 106, 106);">The command line, despite its similarities to a graphical user interface (GUI), provides a powerful way to interact with your computer. 
    Like a GUI, it allows you to create and manage files and folders, but instead of clicking icons, you use text commands. 
    These commands are executed by typing them at the command prompt, usually denoted by symbols like $, %, or #. 
    You can perform various tasks with command line commands. For instance, "whoami" retrieves your username, "pwd" tells you your current directory, and you can modify commands using parameters or flags. 
    For example, "id -un" provides specific login information. The command line also facilitates navigation through the file system, with "ls" listing directory contents and "cd" allowing you to change your current directory. 
    You can create new files using the "touch" command. Text editors like Vim and Nano can open and edit these files, making the command line a useful tool for computer management.

    I really like this project and I am fascinated by the algoritm that goes into the calculation. 
    It is extermely visually appealing and I like the way that every user has a personalised experience. 
    It's also super funny.

        I like this project a lot because its very visually appealing and i'm a sucker for emojis. 
        Although I'm sure there is a lot that goes into it, it seems like something relatively simple and managable that I could potentially do with the skills developed in this class!

    This website is just extremely visually appealing. 
    The music is a really nice touch aswell and the whole sensory expereince was just incredible 
</p>

<!--Overall I really liked this project, there wasn't really anything in terms of the code that made it difficult! -->
